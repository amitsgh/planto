## Inspiration

Planto has been developed for the farming sector. In India, farmers are major stakeholders and 70% of the population is involved in farming. Having such a huge emphasis on the country, more attention should be paid to this sector's development and growth.

## Target Audience

This app mainly targets the farmers whether large scale or small scale. Farming holds a significant share in the country's GDP, and even some small mistakes can impact the economy. The main purpose of this application is to help the farmers deal with certain issues that can play a major role in destroying the whole crop and make it difficult for them to earn a living. These issues can be handled on the ground level and can save the farmers from losses and can help contribute to an even larger share in the GDP of the nation.

## Features

### 1. Plant Disease Prediction

Our app is user-friendly and has been built keeping in mind the difficulties that the farmers face and provides them the solution as well. Planto focuses on the condition of leaves. It scans the leaves and informs the farmer about any discrepancy that may arise in a long run and help them save their plantation from getting destroyed.

### 2. Disease Information & Management
